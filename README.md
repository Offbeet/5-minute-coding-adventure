# 5 Minute Coding Adventure (5MCA)
A simple and non-serious HTML game coded in Scratch/TurboWarp, archived here on GitHub.

# Game Link
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1261913007 -- Contains the latest version of the game

# HOW TO PLAY THE GITHUB VERSION(s) OF 5MCA
1. After downloading the .sb3 file from the version you wish to use, you must then go to either https://scratch.mit.edu OR https://turbowarp.org (personal preference to which, I personally reccomend TurboWarp)
2. If on Scratch, create a new project (You may need an account to do this, I forget and am too lazy to check as of writing)
3. In the top left of the screen, in the menu bar, click File > "Load from Computer" and select the downloaded copy of 5MCA
4. Wait for the project to load, and then click the green flag (in a varied location depending on intermediary steps) and voila! Enjoy!

# Changelog
## Version 4 (Visual Wow Update) (01/07/2026):
- Improved the visuals for the UI, no longer relies on Scratches built in variable displays.
- Added multipliers, now you can reach 10k points MUCH easier! (May be reworked in the future)
- Changed the boundary box of the game to be a square rather than a 4:3 ratio, this is mostly a visual choice rather than for any gameplay reason.
- Sound effects should now work entirely properly as the sound effects for hitting the ball and combos were moved to different sprites. (Still unsure if it was even a problem, but now it 100% isn't)

## Version 3 (Little Things Update) (01/06/2026):
